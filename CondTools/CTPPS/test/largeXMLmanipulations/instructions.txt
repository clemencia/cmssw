#first run the two scripts to "split" the timing and real alignment
python3 script_tables_global.py
python3 script_tables_timing.py
#the result should be a bunch of single-iov-xmls files
#create a txt file with the file names of real aligment single-iov xml files
ls -ltrh largeXMLmanipulations/real*xml > list_realali.txt
#then run the comparison
python3 -i check_iov_boundaries_global_vs_timing.py
### the list of iov start numbers to add to the skip list in run_...._v2.py
### a = [i for i in list_goodtiming if i not in list_goodreal]

## One last detail: in order to include the iov boundaries for RPix alignments we need to 
## CREATE the real_alignment_iovXXX.xml files for those boundaries (286693 and 309055)
## by copying the previous IOV file and fixing the iov first and last numbers in the xmls

## Finally to create the sqlite you must run
python3 run_rp_realalignment_table_v2.py list_realali.txt largeXMLmanipulations <true or false> <tagname> <sqlitefilename> 

## option true will make a "dry run", just checking the files and iovs without running cmssw
## option false will run cmssw and create the sqlite containing the tag  will all iovs in list_realali and checking for duplicates
