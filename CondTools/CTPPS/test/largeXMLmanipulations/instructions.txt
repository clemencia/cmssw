#create a txt file with the file names of real aligment single-iov xml files

### the list of iov start numbers to add to the skip list in run_...._v2.py
### a = [i for i in list_goodtiming if i not in list_goodreal]

## One last detail: in order to include the iov boundaries for RPix alignments we need to 
## CREATE the real_alignment_iovXXX.xml files for those boundaries (286693 and 309055)
## by copying the previous IOV file and fixing the iov first and last numbers in the xmls
